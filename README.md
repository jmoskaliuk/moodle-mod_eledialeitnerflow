# LeitnerFlow — Spaced Repetition Activity for Moodle

🇩🇪 [Deutsche Version](README-DE.md)

LeitnerFlow brings the proven Leitner flashcard system into Moodle. Questions from the Question Bank become virtual flashcards that move through a series of boxes. Correct answers advance a card; wrong answers send it back. Students work in short, focused sessions and track their progress through a visual dashboard.

**Requires:** Moodle 4.4+
**Current version:** 1.9.0
**License:** [GPL v3+](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)
**Maintainer:** [eLeDia GmbH](https://eledia.de)

## How it works

A teacher creates a LeitnerFlow activity and selects one or more Question Bank categories. Each question becomes a flashcard that starts in Box 1. When a student answers correctly, the card moves to the next box. Wrong answers send it back (configurable). Once a card has been answered correctly enough times, it graduates to "Learned".

Cards in lower boxes appear more frequently, so students naturally focus on what they find hardest. The system supports three wrong-answer behaviours: full reset to Box 1, back one box, or no change.

## Features

**For students:**

- Visual Leitner box display showing card distribution at a glance
- Multi-segment progress bar (warm-to-cool colour gradient: orange → aqua → blue → green)
- Session history with correct rate, progress bars, and duration
- Trend indicator comparing recent sessions to overall average
- Clickable boxes to practise specific difficulty levels
- Card-move animation with configurable feedback style (minimal, encouraging, or off)
- Guided first-visit User Tour (multilingual: EN/DE)

**For teachers:**

- Flexible question sourcing from multiple Question Bank categories
- Configurable box count (1–5), session size, and correct-answers threshold
- Three wrong-answer strategies: reset, back one, no change
- Dynamic or fixed question pools
- Card selection priority: lower boxes first or mixed random
- Optional gradebook integration (percentage of cards learned)
- Per-student report with progress, session count, and reset capability
- Summary dashboard: participant count, question pool size, average learned percentage

**Technical:**

- Full Moodle Question Engine integration (immediatefeedback behaviour)
- Backup and restore support
- Privacy API / GDPR compliant (export + deletion)
- Event logging (session started, session completed, progress reset)
- Course reset support
- AMD JavaScript modules (keyboard shortcuts, animations, confirmation dialogs)
- 22 PHPUnit tests for the core Leitner engine
